</Split>

- Lightweight
- Portable
- Scalable

<Notes>
  (1) containers run natively on Linux, sharing kernal; lower overhead
  (1) VMs full guest OS with virutal access to host resources through "hypervisor".
  (1) Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  (1) Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  (1) Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  (1) Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  (1) Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  (1) Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

# Docker (CLI) Concepts
We'll focus on:

- ~~`Stack`~~
- ~~`Swarm`~~
- ~~`Service`~~
- `Container`
- `Image`
- `Dockerfile`
- (`Volumes`)

# Our *first* app

<h3 className="text-gray-500 mb-10">"Talking whales"</h3>

1. Pull images from public registry
1. Run images as containers and execute their commands
1. Understand how to clean up

---

Pull the required image from public registry

```sh
docker pull docker/whalesay
```

---

Check the image is available on your machine

```sh
docker images
```

---

Run the image to get a container

(and provide the args to the default `CMD`)

```sh
docker run docker/whalesay 'docker rules!'
```

---

Is the container still running?

<Appear>
<p className="text-gray-600">How do we check?</p>
<p className="text-gray-600">How do we re-execute the command?</p>
</Appear>

---

```sh
docker container ls
```

---

View all containers (including those which are stopped)

```sh
docker container ls -a
```

---

# <i class="em em-koala"></i> Tip

Using `docker run` will auto `pull` images which it can't find locally

---

# Cleanup

1. Remove containers
1. Remove images

---

## Cleanup Containers

Get container ID

```sh
docker container ls
```

Remove

```
docker container rm <container_id>
```

---

# <i class="em em-koala"></i> Tip

Delete all (stopped) containers

```
docker container prune
```

See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_prune/

---

# Cleanup Images

Get image ID

```sh
docker image ls
```

Remove

```
docker image rm <image_id>
```

---

# <i class="em em-koala"></i> Tip

Delete all unused images

```
docker image prune
```

See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/

---

# <i class="em em-koala"></i> Tip

- Delete all containers **first** before deleting images
- Containers are *tied* to an image so you get an error if you delete an image that has a linked container reference

---

# Recap

1. We've played around with some Docker resource concepts:
    - `image`, `container`
1. We've seem some of the Docker CLI commands:
    - `pull`, `run`, `container`, `image`
1. And we've done all this with some pre-built images from the **docker hub**

---

# How do we create our own images?

# Dockerfile

Recipe guide for creating Docker images

</Notes>

---

# Dockerfile: FROM

Configure the '*base image*'

```
FROM <image>[:<tag>]
```

<p className="text-red-800 text-right">*required</p>

---

## FROM: Examples

```
FROM node:lts-jessie
FROM node:10-alpine
FROM node:12-jessie

FROM ruby:2.6-jessie
FROM ruby:2.5-stretch
FROM ruby:2.4-stretch
```

---
# Dockerfile: RUN

Execute `command` and '*commit*' result on top of current '*layer*'

```
RUN <command>
```

---
## RUN: Examples

```
RUN npm install
RUN bundle install

# Note this is bad;
# we'll find out later why
RUN yum update
RUN yum install -y wget
```

---
# Dockerfile: COPY

Copy files/dirs from `src` (on `host`) to `dest` (in `image`).

```
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
```

---

## COPY: Examples

```bash
COPY ./deploy.sh /deploy.sh

# Some globs can be used as well
COPY package*.json /home/app/

COPY /src /home/app/
```

---

# Dockerfile: EXPOSE

'*Expose*' container port to host

```
EXPOSE <port>[/<protocol>]
```

---

## EXPOSE: Examples

```
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

EXPOSE 5432
EXPOSE 1234/udp
```

<p className="text-gray-600 text-base text-right">TCP is default protocol</p>

---

# Dockerfile: VOLUME

Creates a mount point with the specified name and declare it as holding external (host) data.

```
VOLUME ["<path>"]
VOLUME <path>
```

---

## VOLUME: Examples

```bash
VOLUME /myvol
VOLUME ["/var/www/html"]
VOLUME ["/data"]
```

---

# Dockerfile: USER

Configures `user` for: `RUN`, `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` directives

```
USER <user>[:<group>] or
USER <UID>[:<GID>]
```

---

## USER: Examples

```bash
USER root
USER node
USER www-data
# use user id and group id
USER 1001:1001
```

---

# Dockerfile: CMD

Set default process to execute on startup

```bash
# preferred
CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]
# pass params to ENTRYPOINT
CMD ["param1","param2"]
# Shell form (executed in /bin/sh -c)
CMD command param1 param2
```

---

## CMD: Examples

```
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
CMD ./run.sh
```

---

# Dockerfile: ENTRYPOINT

Configure container that runs as an executable

```bash
# exec form
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
# shell form
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```

---

## ENTRYPOINT: Examples

```bash
ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"]

ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

---

# <i class="em em-koala"></i> Tip

Combine `CMD` with `ENTRYPOINT` to provide configurable defaults

```bash
# Dockerfile -> imaeg name = 'custom-tail'
ENTRYPOINT ["tail"]
CMD ["-5"]
```

---

```bash
# tails 5 lines
docker run custom-tail
# tails 15 lines
docker run custom-tail -15
```

# Exercise

NodeJS App: Creating a Dockerfile

---

# Tasks

Folder: `basic-nodes-dockerfile`

1. Complete the todo list in the template file.
1. Build image
1. Run container and check output

(clone repo if you haven't already)

---

# Solution

---

```bash
FROM node:lts-alpine
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Install app dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
# Add app
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "app.js" ]
```

---

```bash
cd exercies/basic-nodejs-dockerfile
# build image
docker build -t my-node-app .
# run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-node-app
# check output
curl -i localhost:8080
```

---

...

---

# Ecercise

bind mount vols

---

# Multi-stage builds

FROM AS

COPY --from

---

# Exercise

Update above to use multi stage

---

# Docker
Best practices

1. Single process per container
1. Keep images small
1. Use the right *base image*
1. Use multi-stage builds
1. Combine appropriate `RUN` directives
1. Combine shared components into a `base` image
1. Don't rely on `:latest` tag
1. Use `volumes` for storage

<Notes>
  - base image enables caching and better memory usage
  - Use `bind mounts` in development
</Notes>

---

#  Dockerfile

Best practices

---

1. Order directives from least to most likely to change,
    - e.g. `COPY` should come later
1. Increase specificity in `COPY` to avoid un-intentional cache bust,
    - e.g. don't use `COPY . `
1. Compress `RUN` pkg manager *update* and *install* into same line,
    - e.g. `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install`
1. Use official images where possible
    - reduces maintenance time, reduce size, configured for container use
