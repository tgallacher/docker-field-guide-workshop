# Docker Workshop: Field Guide

A 1 day Docker workshop for beginners.

View workshop [slides here](https://docker-field-guide-workshop.netlify.com).

# Goal

The principal objective of the workshop is to provide a high-level overview of what Docker is and how its many parts fit together to offer tools for rapid development and deployment.

The secondary objective is to provide a process to help reinforce muscle memory, so that the various docker apis/tools become somewhat familiar; and it is thus easier to build knowledge at a self pace.
